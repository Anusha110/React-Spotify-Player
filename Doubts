- Not redirecting to login
- How do we divide into different modules?  (Bsed on responsisbility)
- Solving key error in exported routes using UUID() (put route path in constants, can use the same as key)
- font family Assistant, Verdana not applying  ( google fonts)
- how do you put color names in themes, styled guides  (blue 500)
- mobile first development (depends on applications)
- how do you add the media query constants in to the css styled comp
-  externalUrls: {
      spotify: string
   } does it need a Model (UserStore)  (if think you won't get more in the future then can put externalURLSpotify: string). Otherwise, you can put a separate model.

Action Items

didn't put slash at the end for everything, becuz there are query params after











- not getting match object in History
- user information is null when refreshing the page
- no redirecting to playlists properly, previous click playlist is rendering
- artist id should be stored right
- handle the marquee text and the music player text
